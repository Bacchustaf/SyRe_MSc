   This product includes software developed at
   Converters, Electrical Machines and Drives Research Group (EMD) 
   at The Polytechnic University of Bari in  Bari, Italy. 

   This software contains code derived from Polytechnic University of Bari.
   SyR-e is a Matlab/Octave code developed to design synchronous reluctance machines 
   with finite element analysis and the aid of multi-objective optimization algorithms.

   This code is used for my thesis. The title of my thesis is " Development of an open source
   switched reluctance machine design software." 

   The thesis consists of developing an open source program "SyR-e", which designs 
   synchronous reluctance machines with finite element analysis and 
   the aid of multi-objective optimization algorithms, and comparing 
   the constructed motor and simulation results. 

   The original software is available from
