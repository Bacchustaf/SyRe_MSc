# SyRe_MSc
M.Sc. Thesis Project

I am a M.Sc. student in the area of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics at Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University (METU).

The title of my thesis is " Development of an open source switched reluctance machine design software." 

   The thesis consists of developing an open source program "SyR-e", which designs synchronous reluctance machines 
   with finite element analysis and the aid of multi-objective optimization algorithms, and comparing 
   the constructed motor and simulation results. 
   
   SyR-e is the open source program, which I plan to work on.
   The original software is available from
		                http://sourceforge.net/projects/syr-e/
